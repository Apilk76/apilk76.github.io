Are intellectual pursuits sexy? I contend the answer is 'yes,' and my super-strong argument is "because John Lennon sang so."

In the song "A Day in the Life," the phrase "I'd love to turn you on" is first preceded by a reference to reading ("having
read the book") and then by a witticism (that whole Albert Hall thing). The juxtaposition is good enough for me!
