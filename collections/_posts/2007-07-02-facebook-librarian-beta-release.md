Okay, so instead of working forever to add features and tweak the thing for all of eternity, I've decided to release the
app, see how things mess up, then fix them on the fly. Sounds like a great idea, right? Wellâ€¦ I've been sitting on this
idea for so long that it has to be a diamond. Okay, so try it out and let me know what you think. And keep coming back to
hawidu.com, more cool stuff is on the way.
