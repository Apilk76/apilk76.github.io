I guess I'm just perpetuating the sensationalism, butâ€¦

[The salesgenie.com ads during the Super Bowl were incredibly racist](http://www.calacanis.com/2008/02/03/salesgenie-racist-super-bowl-commercial/).
They actually reminded me of spots I'd seen from the 50s and 60s, prior to political correctness.

[And they were intentionally bad!](http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20071227005453&newsLang=en)
If it wasn't so brilliant, I'd be really angry!

But they were still racist (even considering that they could be considered self-deprecating), so it's tough to know how
to feel. All I know is that I'm not gonna go to salesgenie.
