Is it just me, or are you more likely to get requests and app invites from people you don't care about/don't like?

It makes sense, really. I don't want to waste my REAL friends' time while I try out crummy apps that always default to an
invite page.

Actually, it's kind of a neat mechanism for weeding out non-friends. "Who's (Your name here)? Whoever they are, they've
just invited me to Werewolves one time too many!"
