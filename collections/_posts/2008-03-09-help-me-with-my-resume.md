[My resume](http://resume.bradczerniak.com/) is finally ready for the web. However, I'm interested in your opinion and criticism, so please contact me with your thoughts.

Also, for your time-wasting pleasure, I give you: <del title="This was a link to a blue screen, from back when Baker and Taylor pages took nearly a minute to load">Faker Baker BS3</del>. Anyone's who's ever used B&T knows this screen all too well. Now, all you have to do is point your browser to the page and you'll instantly look busy! For you pros out there, the color is #47768e.
