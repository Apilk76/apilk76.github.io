Chat reference should be **easy**, **instantaneous**, and **pervasive**. It's good to also be **accessible**, **usable**,
**open**, and **attractive**.

It's the first three reasons that I liked [MeeboMe widgets](http://www.meebome.com/)

It's the last four reasons why I now prefer [libraryh3lp](http://code.google.com/p/libraryh3lp/)
or [Google chatback badges](http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2008/02/google-talk-chatback.html).
