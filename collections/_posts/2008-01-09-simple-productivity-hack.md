If you Google yourself often ([and we all do](http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/006076.html))
([and we should](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/reference-check-you-are-who-google-says-you-are.html)), you can
actually save yourself a bit of time by mashing together two simple and free web services:

  1. [Google Alerts](http://www.google.com/alerts)
  2. [Mailbucket](http://mailbucket.org/)

All you gotta do is set up Google Alerts to send searches for your name (or anything you care about for that matter) to
(darn near anything)@mailbucket.org . Then, subscribe to the feed located at http://www.mailbucket.org/(darn near anything).xml .
Personally, I send the alerts to my gmail, filter them, then forward them to mailbucket, but that's a personal preference.

Hints: Daily is annoying. Weekly seems just about right. If you don't have a huge online presence, you might get a lot of repeats.

Why not just read them as an email, you ask? Well, it's mashing two things together, so it doesn't have to make sense! In
my mind, my email and my aggregator are the same darn thing, except that I choose what I want to show up in my
[Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/).

Special thanks to [David Cross](http://www.bobanddavid.com/2007/12/allllllviiiiin.html) for the idea. You're funny.
