Since I feel shafted that "rocket surgery" took off unattributed, I propose the following terms:

  1. stARCHIVE — The act of starring an item in gmail, then immediately archiving it
  2. Fonticate — while used by [Michael Herf ](http://www.stereopsis.com/)as the name for a cool
    [font-picking program](http://www.stereopsis.com/fonticate/), I propose the word be used in this manner: The act of
    reformatting a multi-user document (esp. a collaborative powerpoint presentation) by uniformly changing the font and
    various other visual elements
