Some costumes I expect to see either in person or on the interwebs:

  1. Grown Man, dressed as cat — Has detachable plates with various lolcats sayings "I can has costume?" "Invisible
    trick-or-treat," usw.
  2. Wendy's red wig — This will be a part of my costume fosho. I want to yell "Hot Juicy Burger" at the library. That is all
  3. Caveman — puh-leaze
  4. Think about some of these: Domino's Oreo Dessert Pizza facial hair, "I'm thinking Arby's" hat logo headwear

Am I missing something?
