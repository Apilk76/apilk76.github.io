  1. Take apart the message of the Microsoft Sync commercials: "If you use our product, you will become a hazard to yourself
    and others due to your own idiocy"
  2. [The Love Guru](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811138/) — Mike Myers will forever be Austin Powers. Despite hiding himself
    as a computer-animated ogre for so long, one look at him trying to play some character in real life and the 'shag-a-delic'
