I'm hesitant to call it "Librarian 2.0 beta" quite yet (I'm still working on the most-requested feature update), but today
I launched a widget gallery and the new facebook invite system, so maybe things will pick up.

Be on the lookout, librarians â€” In the near future I will likely be launching "subject specialist" features that will allow
multiple librarians in one network, as well as volunteer selection based on subject specialty. I'm hoping this doesn't lead
to crude volunteer vandalism (ie. experts in "the ladies" and so forth (don't take it, that's mine! jk)), but otherwise am
optimistic that librarians will be actually connecting to patrons in worthwhile ways (which I'm not sure has happened up
to this point).
