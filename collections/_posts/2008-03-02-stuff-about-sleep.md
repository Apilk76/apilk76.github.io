First, caffeine withdrawal feels like angry jetleg with headaches.

Second, and this is a very local thing. One of my dreams last night had a creepy fictional wild-west amusement park south
of Temple on Cass. There was a saloon, an arcade, and trains going **everywhere**. It was AWESOME. Just my opinion, but I
think Detroit should build "Wild west town" just north of [Foxtown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricktown%2C_Detroit).
