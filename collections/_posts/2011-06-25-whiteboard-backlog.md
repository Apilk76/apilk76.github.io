My apartment is covered in dry erase boards. I like to use them. Here are some examples:

{% include atoms/image.html
  alt="Nyan cat in whiteboard drawing style"
  src="nyan_cat.jpg"
%}

{% include atoms/image.html
  alt="The letter that Johnnie Walker read"
  src="the_letter_that_johnnie_walker_read.jpg"
%}

This tendency has led to me using them for my slide presentations. I've had two in the hopper that I presented at the
Michigan Library Association's Tech Escape workshop in May. As is always the case with my presos, be forewarned that they
contain a lot of salty language:  If you have any dry erase board art requests, please leave them in the comments and I
will try my best.
