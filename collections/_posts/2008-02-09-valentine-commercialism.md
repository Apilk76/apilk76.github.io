Anodizing consumer electronics varying shades of pink does not make them any more romantic as gifts. This is even true for iPods.

Here's the range:

  * Just friends — cheesy card (bonus points if it's from one of those elementary school set boxes, and/or contains a Fun Dip candy treat)
  * More than "" — Chocolate
  * Sucking up — Chocolate Flowers
  * Extra-special Day and/or you're loaded — Jewelry

Note the lack of cell phones and other gizmos on the list. There may be instances when the above guidelines do not apply,
but giving a Magenta Blackberry Pearl seems a little messed-up on such an occasion.
