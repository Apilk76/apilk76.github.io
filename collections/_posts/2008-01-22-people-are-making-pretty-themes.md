title: "People are making pretty themes!"

Before I launch the gallery feature (which I want to get right the first time, given that many people have made
default-identical themes just to test out the app), I'm the only person who's had an easy look at all the themes people
have been making. It's quite exciting! For instance:

{% include atoms/image.html
  alt="Finnish theme"
  src="atheme.jpg"
%}

From a recent Finnish visitor. Keep up the good work, everyone!
