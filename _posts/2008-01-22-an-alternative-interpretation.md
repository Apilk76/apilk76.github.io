Are intellectual pursuits sexy? I contend the answer is 'yes,' and my super-strong argument is "because John Lennon sang so." In the song "A Day in the Life," the phrase "I'd love to turn you on" is first preceded by a reference to reading ["having read the book"] and then by a witticism [that whole Albert Hall thing]. The juxtaposition is good enough for me!
