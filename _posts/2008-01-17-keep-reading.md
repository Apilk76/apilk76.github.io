[![Cult of the Amateur](http://books.google.com/books?id=W4YuAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&sig=l5vDLsya7ieCQcjE8lzq0uoJFm4)](http://books.google.com/books?id=W4YuAAAACAAJ)

**Important**: It is just as possible for a book to have incorrect or misleading information as it is for a website; just read [The Cult of the Amateur](http://books.google.com/books?id=W4YuAAAACAAJ) and you'll know what I'm talking about. [A recent article](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/magnus_linklater/article3193083.ece) supports [Andrew Keen's ](http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/) "People are reading print sources less, and that means the end of civilization [paraphrased]" argument.

Now, I happen to have some anonymous circulation statistics from a public library: after crunching the numbers, I found that among the people who currently have a book checked out, the average number out for people born before 1980 was **4.47**, while those after 1980 is **3.75**. Not exactly a huge generation gap (albeit the numbers are a tad skewed). In the library world, we call finding and assessing information of any format "[Information Literacy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_literacy)" The ultimate responsibility for the dissemination of information rests with the reader, bottom line.
