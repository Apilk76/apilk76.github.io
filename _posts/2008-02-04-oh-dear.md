I guess I'm just perpetuating the sensalionalism, butâ€¦

[The salesgenie.com ads during the Super Bowl were incredibly racist.](http://www.calacanis.com/2008/02/03/salesgenie-racist-super-bowl-commercial/) 

They actually reminded me of spots I'd seen from the 50s and 60s, prior to political correctness. [And they were intentionally bad!](http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20071227005453&newsLang=en) If it wasn't so brilliant, I'd be really angry! But they were still racist (even considering that they could be considered self-deprecating), so it's tough to know how to feel. All I know is that I'm not gonna go to salesgenie.
