Today's circulating single-volume wonder was the barely-tolerable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Strange-Unexplained-Physical-Phenomena/dp/081038843X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1231382994&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Encyclopedia of Strange and Unexplained Physical Phenomena</em></a> [Jerome Clark, Gale, 1993].

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121" title="Encyclopedia of Strange and Unexplained Physical Phenomena" src="http://hawidu.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/paranormal.jpg" alt="Encyclopedia of Strange and Unexplained Physical Phenomena" width="467" height="200" />

It must be tough to put together such a work, as most such phenomena have no evidence whatsoever, though many readers may have beliefs. Clark ranged between absolute denial of claims and a believing awe of others. This editorializing wrecked the book's credibility for me.

Probably the most heinous offense was the repeated use of quotations and testimony from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_T._Sanderson">Ivan T. Sanderson</a>, who either ended up wrong (In the case of Jacko), or sputtered gibberish (as in his 'penguin' theory of the White River Monster). While Sanderson is likely a respected name in cryptozoology <em>et cetera</em>, the frequent mentions detracted from the authority of the encyclopedia.
