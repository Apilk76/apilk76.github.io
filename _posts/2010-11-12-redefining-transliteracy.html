<h3>Preface</h3>
This is a long-ish essay about transliteracy that I've been editing for a few months now. I've asked for feedback from the <a href="http://librariesandtransliteracy.wordpress.com/">Libraries and Transliteracy</a> group [full disclosure: you <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/librariesandtransliteracy/browse_thread/thread/b9edeb9f017c8fd8">can read the discussion here</a>. I come off as arrogant, but luckily, not wrong] and <a href="http://travelsinvirtuality.typepad.com/suethomas/">Sue Thomas</a>, and have based this version on their responses. Thank you to everyone who helped in getting this essay ready.
<h3>Introduction</h3>
The working definition of transliteracy, as <a href="http://nlabnetworks.typepad.com/transliteracy/">defined by PART</a> (Production and Research in Transliteracy):
<blockquote>Transliteracy  is the ability to read, write and interact across a range of platforms,  tools and media from signing and orality through handwriting, print,  TV, radio and film, to digital social networks.</blockquote>
This  definition is both internally and externally inconsistent. The  combination of problems requires a re-definition of the term such that  transliteracy can be an effective interdisciplinary field of study.
<h3>Working Definition Inconsistencies</h3>
The  definition mentions signing, orality, handwriting, and other things  claimed to be platforms, tools, and media. Questions naturally emerge:  Is handwriting a platform, tool, or medium? What about orality? It is  unclear whether the things in the list are platforms, tools, or media at  all, and if they are it is not clear in which category any one of them  belongs.

A second problem follows. If handwriting is a medium and orality a tool (purely for example), how does one go across them? The <em>trans-</em> prefix of transliteracy means across or between; how does one go across not just different things, but different <em>types</em> of things?

Additionally, “signing and orality <strong>through</strong> handwriting, print, TV, radio and film, <strong>to</strong> digital social networks” is imprecise. There are ostensibly infinite  platforms, tools, and media that fit into the framework. Listing a  random, partial set of supposedly-included concepts is not how  definitions are written.

The  list also appears to assert a hierarchy, as if signing is somehow  primitive compared to online social networks. Since the list is not  purely alphabetical or chronological (TV comes before radio and film),  it appears haphazard at best and literacy-elitist at worst.

It  is also unclear why interaction is listed with reading and writing as  it is redundant. Interaction is merely a series of reading and writing  acts.

The  biggest problem, and the one that leads to a solution, is that literacy  is not the ability to read, write, and interact on a particular  platform, tool, or medium. Literacy is the ability to encode and decode  (since reading and writing are handwriting-centric activities)  information in a particular <strong>language</strong>. Surely <em>trans-</em>literacy should then be
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">an ability to encode and decode information <strong>between or across languages</strong>.</p>
This definition can be shortened to
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">an ability to communicate across languages</p>
for  most purposes. However, this iteration is less precise since the  concept of communication often includes meaning, which is addressed  later in this essay.
<h3>Defining Assumptions</h3>
<em>The ability to encode and decode information in a particular language</em> is not a definition for literacy in any known dictionary. Owing to its precision, it should be in the future.

The  most common dictionary definition of literacy is concise: “The ability  to read and write.” What is it that the literate person reads and  writes? Information.

What does the literate person read and write information <em>in</em>?  A passer-by on the street, asked if they were literate in the English  language but not the Russian language, would be able to confidently  answer yes or no to the query. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language">Languages themselves are defined</a> as systems for encoding and decoding information. Language as the base  unit of literacy thus follows inductively from the vernacular and  deductively from the definition of language.

Literacy  purists may scoff at switching from reading/writing to  decoding/encoding. There is a hearty debate as to whether understanding a  spoken language constitutes a literacy. It is simple enough to agree  that it does, with the caveat that generalizing makes the concept  deviate slightly from the vernacular form.
<h3>Languages</h3>
Must  an English-literate person learn English Braille? When someone first  learns to understand spoken English, are they conclusively literate in  English?

No.  Very few people can be considered completely English literate. Spoken  English, written English, and English Braille are all different  languages. They are different <em>systems of signs and symbols for encoding and decoding information</em>. Surely they share similarities to the point that they can be considered in the same language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_family">family</a>,  but each facilitates communication using a different method. A person  who understands spoken English is spoken English literate. Even to that  point their literacy may not be comprehensive, as the English lexicon is  huge and constantly-growing, and various spoken dialects of English  exist that differ significantly.

<a href="http://www.emaki.net/vislang.html">Visual language</a> works the same way. People can use different visual dialects with different <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/visual-grammar/">visual grammars</a> to communicate the same message. This is the terminology that artists  and designers use to talk about their crafts. If transliteracy studies  seeks to be interdisciplinary, using linguistic terminology is a great  start.
<h3>The Medium is the Message[‘s Partner]</h3>
When  someone communicates, they go through a process of encoding information  into a language. The message travels on the medium to its destination.  In this sense the medium is synonymous with the term ‘channel’ as it  applies to the transmission model of communication.

For  the purposes of talking about transliteracy, the important endpoints in  a model of communication are where people either encode messages onto a  medium or decode them from one. However, the medium itself only carries  the message and is, as such, <strong>one of the two components of language</strong>.

Multiple  messages can be encoded onto the same medium at the same time. A  business memo can deliver in written language one message, <span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS,sans-serif;">while providing another via the typeface</span>.

In  a similar way, the same message can be delivered via two different  media at the same time. A person shrugging while saying “I don’t know”  illustrates this notion.

In  both circumstances, two separate communications acts are being  performed simultaneously, despite the sharing of a common component.  Since language comprises both message and medium, a change in either  changes the language and its encoding and decoding processes.
<h3>Is Transliteracy Meaning-less?</h3>
Some  models of communication put emphasis on the concept of meaning. The  sender intends to attach a certain meaning to the message and the  receiver derives their own meaning upon decoding the message. Often  these meanings do not agree. The meaning-making process occurs outside  of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Hall_%28cultural_theorist%29#Encoding.2Fdecoding">encoding/decoding</a> process, however.

This  appears to be a cold notion, that meaning is outside the scope of  transliteracy. However, it meshes well with the original divide between  transliteration and translation. A person who transliterates is able to  do a literal, meaning-independent task. A person who translates takes  meaning into account such that the completed translation is not a  literal comparison to the original work.

It  is worth noting, since the examples provided are placed in the context  of the transmission model of communication, that the transmission model  is often criticized for not explicitly addressing meaning or action. In  both cases, such criticisms are unwarranted. Since meaning-making occurs  before the encoding process or after the decoding process, a separate  meaning-making process can be attached to a sender or receiver where  applicable. Similarly, action is often a separate communication act.  Communication acts of a common thread may be daisy-chained, ran  parallel, and branched using the components of the model to illustrate  concurrency and causes and effects.
<h3>Reconciliation</h3>
It  is also worth noting that a general definition of literacy, and by  relation transliteracy, should be as compatible with other definitions  of both general and specific nature as possible. This facilitates  interdisciplinary discussion and a useful pedagogical framework. For  instance, a commonly-cited definition like
<blockquote>[the]  ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate,  compute and use printed and written materials associated with varying  contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling  individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and  potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider  society.</blockquote>
as  set forth by UNESCO, should be reconcilable with the general notion of  the base literacy definition used to define transliteracy. “The ability  to communicate in a particular language,” to use the short form, has no prima facie  incompatibilities. The UN definition is broad. Likely this is by  perceived necessity to include areas where bilingualism is prevalent. It  also does not explicitly group literacy competencies by language,  though this characteristic does not make the definitions incompatible  since “varying contexts” is suitably ambiguous.

As  previously explained, the vernacular form of literacy is text-centric.  This is a necessary consideration for a body that uses its internal  definition to measure worldwide literacy rates. However, the concept  limits the perception of language to a particular sensory set of signs  and symbols when such a distinction is unnecessary and  potentially-biased. The UN, as such, may rank areas with verbal or other  communicative emphases lower than print-prevalent areas.

All  literacies should be treated equally. The printed word should not be  considered superior by fiat. The ability for a person to communicate  effectively in common cultural contexts to an extent that makes them a  functional member of society does not necessarily mean having native  written language literacy. In many cultures illiteracy in the area’s  official written language may make it difficult for a person to function  in society. In other cultures it may not. This functional distinction  is a necessary lens for measuring base literacy of a country, region, or  person.
<h3>Other Literacies</h3>
Media  Literacy, Multimedia Literacy, Computer Literacy, Digital Literacy, and  many others fail the test of being language-based. Thankfully, the <a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_us1263805">OED steps up</a> to offer a solution:

2. competence or knowledge in a specified area

Many  of these literacies, as such, can continue to be defined as they are  without hurting anything. Without too much effort, though, the situation  can improve: by making all of these literacies plural.

Computer  literacies would then be all the language (the cool,  system-for-transferring-information kind) abilities involved with using  computers. Wine literacies would be the language skills necessary for  the theory and practice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oenology">Oenology</a>.  This simple semantic change makes the second definition of literacy  superfluous and makes the umbrella term transliteracy easier to wrap  around existing literacy models.

Finally,  the term “Information Literacy” must die. Since all literacies are  information literacies, the plural form “Information Literacies” would  encompass the entire namespace of knowledge. Information Literacy cannot  be a single literacy, either. Information itself is not a language.  Information <strong>must</strong> be encoded into useful forms <em>via</em> language for people or other things to use it.

The  concepts presently under the umbrella of Information Literacy are valid  and useful. The practice of teaching the skills and abilities currently  associated with Information Literacy should continue. Those skills and  abilities should just be called something that makes sense. Information  Literacy (or Literacies) is not the right term.
<h3>So What?</h3>
If  Transliteracy is to be an academically-respectable field of study, it  needs precise, discipline-compatible language for its core concepts.
