I've seen some similar articles [to this one](http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/jan/17/inheritancetax.usa) â€” about how the **super-rich are electing to donate their fortunes** rather than give the money to their heirs. I'm torn on this issue: not that I care if the children of the super-rich are only somewhat-rich, but rather the **outflow of all the money**. In the short term, charitable donations sent to third-world nations are actually more **bang-for-your-philanthropic-buck**. It costs less to affect dramatic change for more people. In the long term, though, developing nations **creates international competition**. In that sense, donating abroad will make it tougher for a rich person's child to amass the same wealth as his/her parents. The alternative would be to donate domestically. Given that our standard of living is currently higher than much of the world, charity can often be 'inefficient'. It is **patriotic**, though, there certainly are noble causes, and it is **less likely to harm our economy**. So, _to all my super-rich readers_: please give your charitable donations some serious consideration. Thanks.
