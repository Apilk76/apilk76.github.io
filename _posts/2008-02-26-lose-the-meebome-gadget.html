Chat reference should be <strong>easy</strong>, <strong>instantaneous</strong>, and <strong>pervasive</strong>. It's good to also be <strong>accessible</strong>, <strong>usable</strong>, <strong>open</strong>, and <strong>attractive</strong>.

It's the first three reasons that I liked <a href="http://www.meebome.com/">MeeboMe widgets</a>

It's the last four reasons why I now prefer <a href="http://code.google.com/p/libraryh3lp/">libraryh3lp</a> or <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2008/02/google-talk-chatback.html">Google chatback badges.</a>
