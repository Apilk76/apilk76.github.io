Hey everybody. I hope that my relentless testing this afternoon didn't bog down your aggregator. Anyways, I made a little gadget that communicates to independently-hosted blogs via xml-rpc. <a target="_blank" href="http://hawidu.com/projects/post-to-blog-gadget/">You can read all about it here</a>, and also add it. Hope SOMEBODY besides me finds it useful. Oh, and all the source is available at that link too. Enjoy!
