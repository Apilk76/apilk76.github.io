<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=W4YuAAAACAAJ"><img src="http://books.google.com/books?id=W4YuAAAACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;sig=l5vDLsya7ieCQcjE8lzq0uoJFm4" border="0" alt="Cult of the Amateur" width="128" height="192" /></a>

IMPORTANT: It is just as possible for a book to have incorrect or misleading information as it is for a website; just read <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=W4YuAAAACAAJ">The Cult of the Amateur</a></em> and you'll know what I'm talking about.

<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/magnus_linklater/article3193083.ece">A recent article </a>supports <a href="http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/">Andrew Keen's </a> "People are reading print sources less, and that means the end of civilization [paraphrased]" argument.

Now, I happen to have some anonymous circulation statistics from a public library: after crunching the numbers, I found that among the people who currently have a book checked out, the average number out for people born before 1980 was <strong>4.47</strong>, while those after 1980 is <strong>3.75</strong>. Not exactly a huge generation gap (albeit the numbers are a tad skewed).

In the library world, we call finding and assessing information of any format "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_literacy">Information Literacy.</a>" The ultimate <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia;">responsibility</span> for the dissemination of information rests with the reader, bottom line.
