--- meta: _edit_last: "1" type: post published: true status: publish title: Context in the Future tags: - Predictions layout: post --- The strongest argument for a centralized personal account that is device-decentralized is the elimination of redundancy. Read that again. I'm claiming (without prior research) that holistic web services are most efficiently disbursed through a monopolistic provider. 

  * The _simple_ principle of this is that you **don't want to remember web addresses, account names and passwords**. It's a big hassle to check tons of sites all the time. Email notification, RSS, and widgets currently help with this, but a central system is better at it. 
    * There is evidence of this. Look at **portal sites**. I'm more likely to use a Google service than an external one, even if the Google features are lacking -- if it means I only have to **go to one site instead of two**.
    * Providers (esp. Google) are not using predatory tactics, but are rather naturally gaining comprehensive market share. Yes, the **long tail** is important, but **everything on the web is still bunching up**.
  * The **entire concept of media is built around context**.
Future media solutions will know a user's background knowledge -- and leave
out redundant information.

  * If I read an article about America, the content provider doesn't have to assume I know when Columbus sailed the ocean blue -- they'll KNOW I know it, because their central system told me.
  * In order for this power to work, it must be tied into almost my entire media experience. That is why it will not be stored on a local device.
Just a thought.
