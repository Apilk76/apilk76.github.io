For 2011, my New Year's resolution was three words: exploration, patience, <strong>transparency</strong>. It's been a goal of mine to assess the documents in my Google Docs, share as appropriate, and disseminate the information once available.

It's with that goal in mind that I'm <a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BwO-tzjW6IxxMzFkMWEyOTUtMDc4Ni00ZWFjLThiZGEtNGQyYjkzNTVkY2Vj&amp;sort=name&amp;layout=list&amp;num=100">releasing these 65+ documents</a>. This release makes up only a fraction of the electronic documents that could tentatively be shared, but it's a start. There's <strong>some good stuff in there</strong>; also, some pretty useless stuff.

I look forward to continuing this exercise as the year goes on.
