<div>Gmail is good.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It has a ton of storage. WSU Webmail does not. It's easy to forward your WSU webmail to a gmail account. Here's how:</div>
In order:
<ol>
	<li><a class="null" href="http://mail.google.com/">create a gmail account</a>.</li>
	<li>Then, <a class="null" href="http://webmail.wayne.edu/">forward your WSU webmail to it</a> (from your WSU account).</li>
	<li>You can also send messages from your gmail as your <a href="http://wayne.edu/" target="_blank">wayne.edu</a> address. You set this up from you gmail account settings.</li>
	<li><a class="null" href="http://www.g04.com/misc/GmailTipsComplete.html">Configure the gmail</a></li>
	<li><a class="null" href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-ways-to-use-gmail-filters.html">Apply Filters</a></li>
</ol>
<div>Applying filters is the most important part of this equation. Experts generally agree that you should <a class="null" href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/the-7-energy-sinkholes-and-how-to-avoid-them.html">kick the email-checking habit</a>. By reducing the amount of stuff-you-don't-wanna-read from your inbox, you can save tons of time! Here are a few of my favorite filters (specific to the WSU LISP Listserv):</div>
<div></div>
<div>[<strong>Reduces the number of textbook-selling emails</strong>]</div>
<div>To: LISPINF</div>
<div>Has the Words: (sale OR selling OR wanted OR needed OR Looking) AND (book OR textbook OR texts OR text)</div>
<div>Doesn't Have: "Job Posting" OR "REMINDER"</div>
<div>Do this: Skip Inbox, Apply label "Textbooks"</div>
<div></div>
<div>[<strong>Unsuccessful unsubscribe attempts can get annoying!</strong>]</div>
<div>Has the Words: signoff lispinf
Do this: Skip Inbox, Apply label "idiot"</div>
<div></div>
<div>[<strong>Lets me browse the Job Postings when it's occasionally useful to me</strong>]</div>
<div>Subject:(JOB POSTING)
Do this: Skip Inbox, Apply label "Job Posting"</div>
<div></div>
<div>One thing you can do with filters is forward your emails -- So, using <a class="null" href="http://www.mailbucket.org/">mailbucket</a>, you can make RSS feeds for certain threads.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you have any questions, leave them in the comments. Thanks!</div>
