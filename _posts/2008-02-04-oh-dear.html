I guess I'm just perpetuating the sensalionalism, but...

<a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2008/02/03/salesgenie-racist-super-bowl-commercial/">The salesgenie.com ads during the Super Bowl were incredibly racist.</a> They actually reminded me of spots I'd seen from the 50s and 60s, prior to political correctness.

<a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20071227005453&amp;newsLang=en">AND THEY WERE INTENTIONALLY BAD!</a> If it wasn't so brilliant, I'd be really angry!

But they were still racist (even considering that they could be considered self-deprecating), so it's tough to know how to feel. All I know is that I'm not gonna go to salesgenie.com.
