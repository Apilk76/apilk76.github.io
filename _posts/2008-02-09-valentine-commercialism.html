Anodizing consumer electronics varying shades of pink does not make them any more romantic as gifts. This is even true for iPods.

Here's the range:
<ul>
	<li>Just friends - cheesy card (bonus points if it's from one of those elementary school set boxes, and/or contains a Fun Dip candy treat)</li>
	<li>More than "" - Chocolate</li>
	<li>Sucking up - Chocolate   Flowers</li>
	<li>Extra-special Day and/or you're loaded - Jewelry</li>
</ul>
Note the lack of cell phones and other gizmos on the list. There may be instances when the above guidelines do not apply, but giving a Magenta Blackberry Pearl seems a little messed-up on such an occasion.
