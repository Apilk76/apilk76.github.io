Since I feel shafted that "rocket surgery" took off unattributed, I propose the following terms:
<ol>
	<li>stARCHIVE - The act of starring an item in gmail, then immediately archiving it.</li>
	<li>Fonticate - while used by <a href="http://www.stereopsis.com/">Michael Herf </a>as the name for a cool <a href="http://www.stereopsis.com/fonticate/">font-picking program</a>, I propose the word be used in this manner: The act of reformatting a multi-user document (esp. a collaborative powerpoint presentation) by uniformely changing the font and various other visual elements.</li>
</ol>
