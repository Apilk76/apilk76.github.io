Chat reference should be **easy**, **instantaneous**, and **pervasive**. It's good to also be **accessible**, **usable**, **open**, and **attractive**. It's the first three reasons that I liked [MeeboMe widgets](http://www.meebome.com/) It's the last four reasons why I now prefer [libraryh3lp](http://code.google.com/p/libraryh3lp/) or [Google chatback badges.](http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2008/02/google-talk-chatback.html)
