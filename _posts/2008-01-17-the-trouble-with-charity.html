I've seen some similar articles <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/jan/17/inheritancetax.usa">to this one </a>-- about how the <strong>super-rich are electing to donate their fortunes</strong> rather than give the money to their heirs.

I'm torn on this issue: not that I care if the children of the super-rich are only somewhat-rich, but ratherÂ the <strong>outflow ofÂ all the money</strong>.

In the short term, charitable donations sent to third-world nations are actually more <strong>bang-for-your-philanthropic-buck</strong>. It costs less to affect dramatic change for more people. In the long term, though, developing nations <strong>creates international competition</strong>. In that sense, donating abroad will make it tougher forÂ a rich person's child to amass the same wealth as his/her parents.

The alternative would be to donate domestically. Given that our standard of living is currentlyÂ higher than much of the world, charity can often be 'inefficient'. It is <strong>patriotic</strong>, though, there certainly are noble causes, and it is <strong>less likely to harm our economy</strong>.

So, <em>to all my super-rich readers</em>: please give your charitable donations some serious consideration. Thanks.
