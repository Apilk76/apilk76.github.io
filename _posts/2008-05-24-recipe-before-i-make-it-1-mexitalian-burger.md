Part 1 in a continuing series where I think up a recipe, post it, **then** make it. I will post later as to whether it's worth making/eating. I will try to be elaborate with the actual procedural recipes; but right now I'm quite hungry, so here's the menu description:

##MexItalian Burger

A 1/4 lb patty, covered with shredded Mexican cheeses, Black beans, and Jalapenos, all on a Bruschetta-like bread bun.
