I like to use them. Here are some examples: [![](http://hawidu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/nyan_cat-300x224.jpg)](http://hawidu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/nyan_cat.jpg) [![](http://hawidu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/the_letter_that_johnnie_walker_read-224x300.jpg)](http://hawidu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/the_letter_that_johnnie_walker_read.jpg) This tendency has led to me using them for my slide presentations. I've had two in the hopper that I presented at the Michigan Library Association's Tech Escape workshop in May. As is always the case with my presos, be forewarned that they contain a lot of salty language:  If you have any dry erase board art requests, please leave them in the comments and I will try my best.
