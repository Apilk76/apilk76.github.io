This year I'm doing something new every week. Sometimes it'll be accomplishing a particular thing (like writing all my representative legislators), but more often it will be a daily activity for the week, like watching a Woody Allen film nightly. As you may have guessed, I'll be blogging these experiences.
<h3>Week 1</h3>
This week I'm spending 2 hours a day doing HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) on <a href="http://www.mturk.com">Amazon's Mechanical Turk</a>. At the end of the week I hope to have earned enough to buy something (from Amazon of course).
<h4>Quick Summary</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Mechanical Turk is named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk">a famous fake chess-playing automaton</a></li>
	<li>It's "A Marketplace for Work," where you can offer a bounty for a simple task, or perform the task for a tiny sum</li>
	<li>Tasks are generally between $.01 and $5, and take between a minute and a few hours</li>
	<li><strong>You can make money</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>What I did</h4>

This was a fool&#39;s errand."]<img class="size-full wp-image-102" title="The Turk Interface" src="http://hawidu.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/turk.jpg" alt="The Interface Used on AMT" width="422" height="264" />[/caption]

It took about 15 minutes for 55 pages of the same thing, bringing me a few cents."]<img class="size-full wp-image-101" title="A Simple HIT" src="http://hawidu.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/hit.jpg" alt="A Simple Task I performed" width="422" height="264" />[/caption]
<h4>What I Learned Today</h4>
<ul>
	<li>A lot of your time is spent finding tasks, not performing them</li>
	<li>The per-hour equivalent of working on Turk is sub-poverty</li>
	<li>The easiest tasks generally have lots of available HITs</li>
	<li>It's most fulfilling to forget about the money and find tasks where you can help the requester with your special skills (I'm talking to you, librarians and web developers!)</li>
</ul>
