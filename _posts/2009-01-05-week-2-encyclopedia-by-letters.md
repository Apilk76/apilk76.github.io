The impression I got from Jonathan Alter's [The Defining Moment](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63680088?tab=details#tabs) (or maybe it was a PBS special) was that FDR remained isolationist as late as his 1940 campaign. Even so, it seems people were derided for being isolationist and/or pacifist earlier than that. The things you learn! BTW, did you know Charles Lindbergh was born in Detroit?

Altogether, it's a neat little two-volume set.

[Week 1 note: I had a Turk-free weekend. When I've completed 8 hours, I'll post the final tally].
