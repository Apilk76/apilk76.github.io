Gmail is good.

It has a ton of storage. WSU Webmail does not. It's easy to forward your WSU
webmail to a gmail account. Here's how:

In order:

  1. [create a gmail account](http://mail.google.com/).
  2. Then, [forward your WSU webmail to it](http://webmail.wayne.edu/) (from your WSU account).
  3. You can also send messages from your gmail as your [wayne.edu](http://wayne.edu/) address. You set this up from you gmail account settings.
  4. [Configure the gmail](http://www.g04.com/misc/GmailTipsComplete.html)
  5. [Apply Filters](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-ways-to-use-gmail-filters.html)

Applying filters is the most important part of this equation. Experts
generally agree that you should [kick the email-checking
habit](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/the-7-energy-sinkholes-
and-how-to-avoid-them.html). By reducing the amount of stuff-you-don't-wanna-
read from your inbox, you can save tons of time! Here are a few of my favorite
filters (specific to the WSU LISP Listserv):

[**Reduces the number of textbook-selling emails**]

To: LISPINF

Has the Words: (sale OR selling OR wanted OR needed OR Looking) AND (book OR
textbook OR texts OR text)

Doesn't Have: "Job Posting" OR "REMINDER"

Do this: Skip Inbox, Apply label "Textbooks"

[**Unsuccessful unsubscribe attempts can get annoying!**]

Has the Words: signoff lispinf Do this: Skip Inbox, Apply label "idiot"

[**Lets me browse the Job Postings when it's occasionally useful to me**]

Subject:(JOB POSTING) Do this: Skip Inbox, Apply label "Job Posting"

One thing you can do with filters is forward your emails -- So, using
[mailbucket](http://www.mailbucket.org/), you can make RSS feeds for certain
threads.

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments. Thanks!
