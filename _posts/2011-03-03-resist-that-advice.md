title: Resist That Advice 
tags: [Libraries, Web Design]

I'd like to touch briefly on a widely-circulated LJ post by [Aaron Schmidt](http://twitter.com/walkingpaper) entitled [Resist That Redesign](http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/communityopinion/889081-274/resist_that_redesign__the.html.csp). It is generally good advice â€“ using iterative website design rather than relying on complete redesigns. However, I think the advice needs better context.

For one thing, most library websites are really outdated and bad. Comparing the design/development workflows of Apple and Google (nice!) or Amazon and Netflix (not exactly gems of design) to how libraries maintain their sites is apples-to-oranges. If a library has a flat-file website (Not a straw man: this is common in libraries!), performing a complete redesign/redevelopment is probably advisable. **A "slowly evolved" CMS developed in-house at a library is likely to be slapdash**, and there are tons of [available CMSes](http://drupal.org/) that are well-designed, secure, free, and supported. 

What's not mentioned in the original post is that redesigns don't have to be long, painstaking processes. _Bad_ redesign processes are that way, but a sufficiently-experienced and talented designer can ease those woes. **The solution for doing a good redesign is to have a good designer**.

Likewise, iterative design isn't always a breezy process, and it often isn't design. Design needs control; website creative control is often lacking in library environments. What often ends up happening under the guise of "iterative design" is actually a patchwork; sometimes from having too many cooks in the kitchen, sometimes from having one crummy cook. We've all seen these websites; they start out clean and freshly-designed. Then someone pastes in a widget and it clashes with the design. Then comes more widgets ad nauseum until the site looks and works awful. As such, **the solution for doing good iterative design is to have a good designer**.

Library folks: don't resist redesigns. **If a well-designed website is important to you, hire a good web designer**. Trust their judgment to decide whether the best course of action is to iteratively improve your site or to do a full redesign.
