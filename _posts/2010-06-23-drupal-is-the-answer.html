Here are the slides and notes from my <a href="http://refresh-detroit.org/2010/06/22/recap-drupal/">June 16th presentation for Refresh Detroit</a>. I was fortunate enough to be joined by <a href="http://www.commercialprogression.com/">Alex Fisher</a> and <a href="http://switchbackcms.com/">Stephen Colson</a>, who really brought everything together and luckily had all the answers. Thanks again, guys.

The following notes do not reflect the actual presentation. If video evidence comes along to prove this, I will add it to the bottom of the post.
<h2>Slide 1 - Welcome</h2>
Hey, I'm Brad  Czerniak. I'm the web guy at <a href="http://www.cantonpl.org/">Canton Public Library</a>.

Thank you very much for coming to see this  presentation today. And especially thank you to <a href="http://lireo.com/">Deborah</a>, for inviting us  to speak. I hope that what we're talking about will be useful.

My presentation is decidedly impractical - I'm  gonna try to explain what Drupal is and some of how it works.

I'll be followed by two really energetic and  talented guys: <a href="http://www.commercialprogression.com/">Alex Fisher from Commercial Progression</a>, and  <a href="http://switchbackcms.com/">Stephen Colson from Switchback CMS</a>. They will put  the rest of the puzzle together with real world sites and practical demos.

Before  moving on, I'd like to thank all the people who contributed to this crowdsourced presentation, and all the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=108075972555061&amp;ref=ts">local</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/midrupal/">Drupal</a> user <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/ann-arbor">groups</a> for  their support and advice.
<h2>Slide 2 - Drupal is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a free &amp; open source content management system</span> the answer</h2>
<strong>So, right off the bat</strong>:

<a href="http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> is free and open source. It's released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">GNU Public License</a>, which is the same license used for the Linux kernel and around 60% of open source software.

You may have  heard of LAMP. I love lamp. It stands for
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysql">MySQL</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php">PHP</a></li>
</ul>
While Drupal could be considered a typical LAMP application, you should note that only the P is strictly necessary. It can run on Windows or Mac, with various web servers, and with a few different database systems. It is written in the PHP programming language, so you're kinda stuck with  that requirement.

It's been  around for nearly 10 years and a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drupal">whole new version</a> is set to be released soon.

<strong>Drupal is the answer, but what's the question?</strong>:
<ul>
	<li>Do you want a powerful website?</li>
	<li>Do  you want to add more features later?</li>
	<li>Do you need support?</li>
	<li>Do  you want different users to do different stuff?</li>
	<li>Do you want  options? There's an easy way and a hard way for everything in Drupal*</li>
</ul>
I  have to admit something now.
<h2>Slide 3 - Drupal kinda sucks (right out of the box)</h2>
If I have learned anything in the last two years, it's that Drupal is  not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Popeil#Inventions">Ronco Showtime Rotisserie</a>

It's not  "Set it and forget it"

This out-of-the-box  unimpressiveness is by design, though. The use case for Drupal is for a site more sophisticated than a small personal blog. It's assumed that  you'll customize the site to some degree before unleashing it on the  public. It's not strictly necessary, but a site based on a basic Drupal  install won't turn any heads.

Drupal  also has a notorious learning curve, partly due to an administrative interface that tends to scare away beginners. Luckily, one of the big features for the upcoming version is a <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/usability">big improvement in usability</a>.

Let's take a look at what you get out of the  box.
<h2>Slide 4 - Your New Site</h2>
It's like this.

A blue-and-gray theme called "Garland" is set by default, and you have two  content types - page and story.

If you install  Drupal for the first time, this can be an incredibly scary sight.

Content types are  important: They range from "blog post" to page to a form to external  content from RSS feeds to whatever you can dream up. Each content type  has a bunch of options:
<ul>
	<li>Whether  or not you want them to take user comments</li>
	<li>Which users you want  to be able to create, edit, or delete content of that type</li>
	<li>Whether  you want new posts of that type to show up on the homepage</li>
</ul>
Stuff  like that. You can set all of that on your website if you're an  administrator. No coding necessary. Once you get the hang of it, It's  really easy and flexible.
<h2>Slide 5 - The Happy Middle</h2>
And it's that flexibility and ability to do complex things without  code that sets Drupal apart from other solutions.

Here on the left we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails">Rails</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_%28web_framework%29">Django</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeIgniter#CodeIgniter"> CodeIgniter</a>. The basic idea behind all three of them is that they're  frameworks - tools for building web applications that help you do it  quicker than starting from scratch and using some basic guidelines to  make sure they don't suck.

But,  when you install them, you have to write code before you even have a  basic webpage.

On the right we  have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordpress">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediawiki">MediaWiki</a>. Wordpress powers almost every personal  blog on the web. It has like 200 million installs.

MediaWiki is the software that powers Wikipedia  and a ton of other sites.

When you  install them you're up and running. You don't need to worry about the  particulars - just add content. These applications are great if you want  a blog or a wiki, but they take a lot of work and aren't really  intended to do much custom stuff with them.

Drupal  sits in the middle. It gives you the flexibility of coding a site  yourself and the beginnings of common website use cases right when you  install it.
<h2>Slide 6 - Sweet, Sweet Nodes</h2>
So that's sweet, right?

One  of the scary words that's really important to understanding Drupal and  talking shop with other Drupalistas is 'node.'

A node is an individual page or blog post or  whatever you've dreamed up.

All  the real content of your site is made up of nodes. Everything is a node.

Node node node.

It  might help to think of a node as a note. Or it might not. But a note or  a memo has a subject line or title and some content. All Drupal nodes  have those things too.

If you want  to organize your notes you might put them in folders or attach Post-Its  to them. This is kind of how Taxonomy works.

Taxonomy  is another one of the scary words.

Here's  the skinny. A taxonomy is a list of descriptive terms. Each term is  like one tag in a tag cloud. You can stick these tags to any node and  use them to organize your content.

Down  here we have the tape dispenser, labeled CCK. That stands for <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">Content  Construction Kit</a>. I'll talk about Modules in the next slide and Steve  will demonstrate CCK specifically, but the general idea is that CCK lets  you attach all kinds of funky things to your notes - like photos and  even whole other notes.
<h2>Slide 7 - Modulez, Drupal Enhancement</h2>
There are 5703 total modules. That's a lot.

A <a href="http://drupal.org/project/modules">module</a> extends (extenze, get it?) what Drupal  does. In fact, Drupal is made up almost entirely of modules. Each one  performs some small role.

So  there's a module called node that does stuff for the nodes from the last  slide.

There's a module called  menu. Confusingly, it mostly has to do with URLs, but kinda not really.  It's one of the things you only have to learn at 1:00AM on a weekend  while wired on Mountain Dew. So we'll skip over that for now.

Those  are modules that come pre-packed when you download Drupal core.

Then there  (contributed) modules nicknamed contrib  modules. These are written by the community to make Drupal awesomer.

CCK  from the last slide is a contrib module lets you add more stuff to your  nodes.

<a href="http://drupal.org/project/pathauto">Pathauto</a> lets you make friendly URLs with  tons of options

<a href="http://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules</a> lets make things happen on  your site. It's a good example of the "easy way" of working in Drupal.

There are modules to give you fancy  calendars, Word-like rich text editors, and 5700 other cool things.
<h2>Slide 8 - Umbday Exampleway</h2>
So here's a rich text editor. You can pick which one <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ckeditor">you want to  use</a> from a bunch of different cool options, then install the module and  set it up.

Boom! Now you have  WYSIWYG capability. And you have options, just like the Drupal gods  intended.

Here in the text box we  have some pig latin. If you aren't fluent, it says "This is a really  dumb example."

It's a dumb example  because --

Well... let's say you  want to make a node and you want that <a href="http://drupal.org/project/dialectic">node to appear in pig latin</a> to  your users.

You can type it out in  plain English and let Drupal do the translation for you.

There  are many modules that let you type in wiki syntax or markdown or plain  URLs or ISBN numbers and the module turns it into something cool for  your users when they view the page. At the library, for instance, we use  double square brackets and links to books in our catalog to import book  cover images and the title and author and stuff. This is a real time  saver and it's all automatic.

And you can mix and  match these filters. If you want to <a href="http://drupal.org/project/htmlpurifier">strip out certain html tags</a> from  the text AND <a href="http://drupal.org/project/pirate">put the text in Pirate-speak</a>, no problem!

This particular example is dumb because when  you're creating or editing that node, you'd just see English. So silly.

Drupal also has non-ridiculous translation  built right in. You can put your menus and other site text in other  languages and switch it for different users and all kinds of stuff. If  that's an important part of your project then you'll be stumbling into a  funky corner of Drupal's learning curve.
<h2>Slide 9 - Users</h2>
One of the most powerful features of Drupal lies with User  management.

Out of the box it  handles sessions and cookies and usernames and passwords and all the  stuff that's a big pain in the butt to get right yourself.

On top of that, you can assign permissions to  users in a really common sense way.

You  can create roles. Roles are containers for much more specific  permissions. An example of a permission is "User can edit their own blog  posts."

So an admin is free to do  anything on the site. A signed-in user can do some things, but is  restricted depending on what roles on the site they've been assigned.

A visitor CAN have permissions, but generally  can just view stuff through their binoculars.

When  you install modules, they often give you new permissions that you can  assign, so it's really easy to make sure that the right people can see  and do the right things.
<h2>Slide 10 - API</h2>
This ability for modules to tie into what Drupal does is because of  the <a href="http://api.drupal.org/">API</a>.

API stands for  Application Programming Interface. It's the way that programmers can  interact with the code and data in an application.

Drupal's API is full of these things called  hooks. These hooks let you add stuff to Drupal in a standard way.

For  instance, when writing a module you might want to use <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/hook_user/6">hook_user</a>. Your  code might say - when a user signs in, redirect them to a different  page.

When one things happens, do other stuff.

Once  you get the hang of it, writing code for Drupal makes a lot of sense.
<h2>Slide 11 - Page Theming</h2>
Along with coding modules, you can also code themes.

You can hard-code HTML into your theme, or put  little bits of PHP in there to display the content from the database  exactly how you want it.

If you  use the default template language, called PHPTemplate, you can specify  regions on your page to hold blocks of dynamic content stored in your  database.

You can move these  blocks around from your browser. Once your theme is coded it's really  easy to put stuff where you want it.

Your  theme consists of a bunch of template files. This one is for an entire  page.
<h2>Slide 12 - Node Theming</h2>
This one is for a single node. A page can have more than one node  displayed at a time, and those nodes can be of many different content  types.

Does that make any sense?

Think of a bag of jelly beans. The page itself  is like the bag. It wraps around all the good stuff.

Each node is like a jelly bean. All the buttered  popcorn flavored beans are from the product content type.

But the bag also has black licorice beans.  These could be wiki entries.

The one page could  show products and wiki entries in one listing.

And  the cool part is that you can make them display however you'd like  using template files.

This doesn't speak to how  gross a bag of popcorn and licorice jelly beans would be, but this is  America so you're free to fill that bag however you'd like.
<h2>Slide 13 - jQuery is Money</h2>
Nothing's better than esoteric programming double entendres.

If you know <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, you know that the shorthand  for the base function is the dollar sign.

But  I also mean that jQuery is money. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117802/quotes">jQuery is so money and it doesn't  even know it!</a>

jQuery is baked in  to Drupal's core. You can even code up your JavaScript is a very  Drupal-ish way using Drupal's concepts of behaviors, settings, and  locales.

But that's not all!

You can use all the same web standards that  everyone else uses, or go your own way.

If  you want to use a particular CSS Framework, there's probably a  pre-existing theme to do it, or you can roll your own.

If you want to do everything in HTML5, Drupal  won't complain.

If you want some  visitors of your site to view your pages in full size and others to get a  mobile page, that's very doable.

Drupal  lets you do what you already know and gets out of your way.
<h2>Slide 14 - All the cool kids are doing it</h2>
What else can I say to convince you that Drupal will work for your  site at the scale you need?

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum">Argumentum  ad Populum</a>. Translated from the Latin it means "All the cool kids are  doing it."

There are a lot more  prominent sites and organizations using Drupal, but these sites are  notable because you're in Drupal when you get to the home page and most  if not all of the content is in Drupal.

That's  a powerful indication of the trust organizations place in Drupal and  the ability of it to suit complex needs.
<h2>Slide 15 - Support</h2>
Another great selling point is the available support.

You  can get help directly from the Community via <a href="http://drupal.org/irc">IRC</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/forum-posting">Forums</a>,and other  avenues.

You can get materials ranging from books  to videos and more from <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a>, <a href="http://apress.com/">Apress</a>, and other publishers

The  creator of Drupal has a company called <a href="http://acquia.com/">Acquia</a> that also lends support.

The  documentation for every aspect of Drupal is amazing. If you want a  quick <a href="http://drupal.org/getting-started/before">how-to for a beginner</a> it's on the Drupal site. If you need  in-depth documentation of the API, it's there too.

Each  module has an issue queue. These are really handy for seeing if the  issue you run into is a known bug or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error">picnic error</a>.

Most any problem you run in to likely has a  forum post or page on the Drupal site. The site search is arguably the  best tool for getting the support you need.

There  are also plentiful user and developer groups. There are at least  three in Metro Detroit.

You can  also hire a firm to develop, design, consult, or for individual bounties  to develop a particular feature.

Options.  Drupal gives you options.

One  more thing...
<h2>Slide 16 - One More Thing... (Views)</h2>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> makes a Developer's life so much easier.

I'm not ashamed to admit that I frequently take  the lazy route. Views is the lazy route in a very real and very cool  way.

Remember the jelly beans?  Let's say all the content on your site is a big tub of jelly beans.

Views lets you put whichever beans from the tub  you want in whichever bag you want.

If  you want an RSS feed with just the images from your products in order  by the date they were last edited, you can do that by playing around in  Views for a couple minutes.

If you  want a block in the sidebar with the latest posts from one user's blog,  that's a cinch.

If you want a  page of all the posts tagged chicken in reverse-title order, you can do  that.

With Views. Views is a  miracle wrapped in a magic trick.

Views  makes learning Drupal SO worth it.
