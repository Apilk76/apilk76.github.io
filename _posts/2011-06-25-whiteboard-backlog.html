My apartment is covered in dry erase boards. I like to use them. Here are some examples:

<a href="http://hawidu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/nyan_cat.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-293" title="Nyan Cat" src="http://hawidu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/nyan_cat-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>

<a href="http://hawidu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/the_letter_that_johnnie_walker_read.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-294" title="The Letter that Johnnie Walker read" src="http://hawidu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/the_letter_that_johnnie_walker_read-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>

This tendency has led to me using them for my slide presentations. I've had two in the hopper that I presented at the Michigan Library Association's Tech Escape workshop in May. As is always the case with my presos, be forewarned that they contain a lot of salty language:

If you have any dry erase board art requests, please leave them in the comments and I will try my best.
