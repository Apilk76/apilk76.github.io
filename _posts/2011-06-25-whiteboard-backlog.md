My apartment is covered in dry erase boards. I like to use them. Here are some examples:

This tendency has led to me using them for my slide presentations. I've had two in the hopper that I presented at the Michigan Library Association's Tech Escape workshop in May. As is always the case with my presos, be forewarned that they contain a lot of salty language:  If you have any dry erase board art requests, please leave them in the comments and I will try my best.
