Today's circulating single-volume wonder was the barely-tolerable [Encyclopedia of Strange and Unexplained Physical Phenomena](http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Strange-Unexplained-Physical-Phenomena/dp/081038843X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231382994&sr=8-1) [Jerome Clark, Gale, 1993].

It must be tough to put together such a work, as most such phenomena have no evidence whatsoever, though many readers may have beliefs. Clark ranged between absolute denial of claims and a believing awe of others. This editorializing wrecked the book's credibility for me.

Probably the most heinous offense was the repeated use of quotations and testimony from [Ivan T. Sanderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_T._Sanderson), who either ended up wrong (In the case of Jacko), or sputtered gibberish (as in his 'penguin' theory of the White River Monster). While Sanderson is likely a respected name in cryptozoology _et cetera_, the frequent mentions detracted from the authority of the encyclopedia.
