Today's Encyclopedia in the series is [The Encyclopedia of Censorship](http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Censorship-Facts-Library-History/dp/0816044643), edited by Jonathon Green. Here are some Pros right off the bat: 

  * It's a single volume, and we all know I'm a sucker for single-volume 'cycs
  * Due to its age, and for other reasons, this particular copy was in the Circulating collection

To the learning!

The entry on Hugh Hefner was particularly entertaining; though I think I found more bad puns than the author had intended. Altogether, this encyclopedia was unimpressive. The articles were pithy to the point of uselessness, and there were many spelling and grammatical errors. Perhaps this is one of those books that's really a dictionary but was entitled with Encyclopedia to sound more official.
