Sometimes it'll be accomplishing a particular thing (like writing all my representative legislators), but more often it will be a daily activity for the week, like watching a Woody Allen film nightly. As you may have guessed, I'll be blogging these experiences. 

### Week 1

This week I'm spending 2 hours a day doing HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) on
[Amazon's Mechanical Turk](http://www.mturk.com). At the end of the week I
hope to have earned enough to buy something (from Amazon of course).

#### Quick Summary

  * Mechanical Turk is named after [a famous fake chess-playing automaton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk)
  * It's "A Marketplace for Work," where you can offer a bounty for a simple task, or perform the task for a tiny sum
  * Tasks are generally between $.01 and $5, and take between a minute and a few hours
  * **You can make money**

#### What I did

#### What I Learned Today

  * A lot of your time is spent finding tasks, not performing them
  * The per-hour equivalent of working on Turk is sub-poverty
  * The easiest tasks generally have lots of available HITs
  * It's most fulfilling to forget about the money and find tasks where you can help the requester with your special skills (I'm talking to you, librarians and web developers!)
