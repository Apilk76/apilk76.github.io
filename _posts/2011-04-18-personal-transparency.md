For 2011, my New Year's resolution was three words: exploration, patience, **transparency**. It's been a goal of mine to assess the documents in my Google Docs, share as appropriate, and disseminate the information once available.

It's with that goal in mind that I'm [releasing these 65+ documents](https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BwO-tzjW6IxxMzFkMWEyOTUtMDc4Ni00ZWFjLThiZGEtNGQyYjkzNTVkY2Vj&sort=name&layout=list&num=100). This release makes up only a fraction of the electronic documents that could tentatively be shared, but it's a start. There's **some good stuff in there**; also, some pretty useless stuff.

I look forward to continuing this exercise as the year goes on.
