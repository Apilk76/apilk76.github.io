My uncle wanted <em><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/154677642&amp;referer=brief_results">How to talk about books you haven't read</a> </em>/ Bayard, Pierre [<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/154677642&amp;referer=brief_results">W</a>:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Talk-About-Books-Havent-Read/dp/1596914696/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200361738&amp;sr=1-1">A</a>:<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DOrCGAAACAAJ">G</a>](SB/HB ), so I checked it out for the semester through school. Gave it a lil' skim before sending it off to him. It's actually really interesting (not the content of the book itself [rather dry] but the overarching concept) to think about the sheer volume of content that will go unread. How many times have you checked out a book only to return it with nary a skim-through? How many cocktail party conversations are a biblio-centric whose-is-bigger competition based on lies?

You're skimming this article right now. AREN'T YOU!?!?

This principle can influence your own behavior, how your librarian finds information for you, and especially how a writer effectively sends his/her message. BTW, <a href="http://modeforcaleb.blogspot.com/2005/10/how-to-skim.html">skimming is an art form</a> that you should have mastered early in high school, but can continually practice; especially for books written by Frenchies (damned frenchmen!).
<ul>
	<li>Consider how you start any quest for information. What is your first 'source?' If you answered Wikipedia, you're certainly not alone.</li>
	<li>Wikipedia doesn't have an absolute maximum length for an article, but brevity (a hallmark of encyclopedic encyclopediae) is encouraged.</li>
	<li>This is why it's great for the hard sciences especially -- the writers are trying to explain complex things in as little space as possible.</li>
	<li>The bite-sized information is gentler on the cranial uptake than, say, a 450-page textbook. <strong>If an article is shorter than your attention span, you're more likely to remember it.</strong></li>
</ul>
It's one of the most shielded non-secrets in everyday life: everyone discussing books and citing papers, though everyone knows that not a lot of reading is really occuring. It almost makes me feel better about being a <a href="http://laurabaas.com/2007/12/25/how-to-talk-about-books-you-havent-read/">non-reading librarian</a>. Can we all just agree that being really well-read is a lot like being really buff -- there's a certain point where it's no longer useful, and you're just showing off.
