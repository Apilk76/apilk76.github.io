Herstory - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herstory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herstory</a>

The words "history" and "his" are not related in any way, yet herstory is still a common term.

The Tenure system:

Since hearing Dr. Steven Levitt (author of Freakonomics) speak at WSU earlier this year, I have been quite interested in the tenure system. Don't be surprised to see something about it in his forthcoming book.

I will elaborate on these topics and some others in the near future.
