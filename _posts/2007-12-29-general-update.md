**General Update** [salutes]

^_How I Met Your Mother_ reference.

AnYwAy, it seems like the main purpose of this blog is to update the status of this blog. Kinda weird, but I've got twenty index cards with super-cool posts that I want to write. It's not a resolution, but I can totally see myself posting more in 2008.

I guess the real purpose of THIS post is to let you know about some of the changes to hawidu.com. I've done more extensive damage to the Wordpress theme, so now it's two-column and much cleaner. Also, the menu structure is cleaner (though still not as intuitive and accessible as I want). Finally, my pride and joy: the [404 error page](http://www.hawidu.com/ugh). Yeah.

Have a Happy New Year! You'll be hearing more from hawidu.com soon.
