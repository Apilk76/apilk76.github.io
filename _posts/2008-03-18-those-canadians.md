It appears that the Canadians are experimenting with [protomatter](http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Protomatter). Just look at this video (video has been lost): It's obvious now that they are trying to create a [Genesis Device](http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Genesis_Device) in an attempt to [terraform](http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Terraforming) the moon. Schematics to followâ€¦
